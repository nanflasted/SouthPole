ServerProcess
  After testing among isClosed() clauses:
    share the JDBC connections in the ServerProcess among all threads to avoid database locks.
  Try implementing using PreparedStatements to make things (potentially) easier

SubServerMap
  Be able to move users around on the map
    So that user interactions could be processed easier
  Spawn towns in a way so that less towns are spawned closer to the center(goal)

TownData
  Spawn towns properly onto the map, aka no hardcoding
  Figure out what a town should have

UserData
  This is generic, but start making rules:
    dogs
    supply
    towns
    //visibility-done
    items,
    etc.
