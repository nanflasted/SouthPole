ServerProcess
  After testing among isClosed() clauses:
    share the JDBC connecions in the ServerProcess among all threads to avoid database locks.

SubServerMap
  Make towns
  Store user positions on the map, and being able to move users around
    So that user interactions could be processed easier

UserData
  This is generic, but start making rules:
    dogs
    supply
    visibility
    items,
    etc.
