ServerProcess
  After testing among isClosed() clauses:
    share the JDBC connections in the ServerProcess among all threads to avoid database locks
  Try implementing using PreparedStatements to make things (potentially) easier

SubServerMap
  Spawn towns in a way so that less towns are spawned closer to the center(goal)
  eventually put everything into databases.

TownData
  Figure out what a town should have

UserData
  Store user data, or at the very least items, into databases instead of a chaotic array list and then serialize it  
  This is generic, but start making rules:
    dogs, supply, towns, items, etc.
